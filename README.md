Levenshtein Dog Picker
======================

What is this?
-------------
A ludicrous script for calculating the Levenshtein distance between a 'name' and the breeds of dog
recognised by [The Kennel Club](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/search/breeds-a-to-z).


Why is this?
------------
Because picking a cute doggo based on some ropey python and your name is self-evidently the best
way to make a major life decision.


How to use
----------
You'll need Python installed, as well as Pipenv. Excessive use might cause issues for The Kennel 
Club's website. And you wouldn't want to do that to them.


Floof!
